# Citibike-Analysis
This is an analysis of the data from Citibike New York for September 2013. Data was cleaned and wrangled to meet the need of exploratory analysis to plan for optimized bike placement and forming a maintenance schedule for the bikes. Analysis was conducted in Python and Tableau. A trend analysis was performed to check the level, underlying trend, seasonality, and risidual. Stationality was checked with Autocorrelatio nand Dickey-fuller Stationarity test. Tableau visualizations were made with geographical representation, and a mathematical model was made to forecast a maintenance schedule for every bike in the fleet based on their hours ridden. Also a plan was developed to shift bikes to optimize availability and delay the need for maintenance.
Python skills used:
Time series analysis: Decomposition, Stationariy, Dickey-Fuller Test
Machine Learning: the elbow teachnique, K-means clustering, Regression analysis
Choropleth plotting
Corolation heatmaps, Correlation Matrix
Scatterplot, pair plotting, categorical plotting
